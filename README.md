## 🎯 Project Overview

**IndigoRL** is a Deep Reinforcement Learning research project focused on solving **long-horizon RPG environments** using **Pokémon Yellow** as a benchmark.

The game presents:
- Extremely sparse rewards
- Large state space
- Long-term dependencies
- Partial observability from pixels alone

To overcome these challenges, IndigoRL combines **visual perception** with **explicit symbolic state extraction from emulator RAM**, allowing the agent to both *see* and *understand* the game world.

---

## 🧩 Technical Description

- **Algorithm:** Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- **Emulator:** PyBoy (headless during training)
- **Observation Space:**
  - CNN-processed screen frames
  - Structured RAM-based state vectors
- **Reward Design:**
  - Dense exploration rewards
  - Event-based progress signals
  - Implicit stagnation penalties

This neuro-symbolic approach significantly improves sample efficiency and training stability.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- ⚡ **Accelerated Emulation** — 1000+ FPS headless training
- 👁️ **Hybrid Observations** — Vision + RAM decoding
- 🗺️ **Dense Exploration Rewards** — Unique `(x, y)` tracking
- 🎥 **Streamer-Ready** — Train in background, watch at 60 FPS
- ⚙️ **Hardware-Aware & Scalable** — CPU usage configurable

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

| Component | Technology |
|---------|-----------|
| Language | Python 3.11 |
| RL | Stable-Baselines3 (PPO) |
| Emulator | PyBoy |
| Vision | OpenCV, NumPy |
| Logging | TensorBoard |

---

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 (Conda recommended)
- Pokémon Yellow ROM  
  Must be named `PokemonYellow.gb` and placed in `roms/`

### Setup Steps

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OutFerz/indigoRL.git
cd indigoRL
conda create -n indigoRL python=3.11
conda activate indigoRL
pip install gymnasium pyboy shimmy stable-baselines3[extra] opencv-python torch-directml
```

### Initial Save State (Skip Intro)

```bash
python src/utils/create_initial_state.py
```

> Play manually until you gain control in Ash’s room, then close the window.

---

## 🏃 Workflow & Execution

### 🧠 Training
```bash
python train.py
```

- Headless, high-speed PPO training
- Automatic checkpoints
- Safe interrupt via **Ctrl + C**

### 👀 Visualization
```bash
python watch_continuous.py
```

- 60 FPS real-time playback
- Hot-reloads improved models

### 📊 Monitoring
```bash
tensorboard --logdir experiments/poke_ppo_v1/logs
```

---

## 🧠 Agent Architecture

**Action Space:**  
`[DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, UP, A, B]`  
`START` and `SELECT` disabled to reduce noise.

**Reward Function:**
```
R_t = R_exploration + R_events
```

## 💻 Hardware & Scalability

Default settings prioritize compatibility with consumer hardware.  
Training parallelism can be scaled by editing `train.py` or setting:

```bash
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=8
```

---

## 🔮 Roadmap

- [ ] Integrate **HippoTorch / S4** for long-term memory
- [ ] Add **Vision-Language Model (VLM)** for on-screen dialogue understanding

---

## 📜 Disclaimer

This project is for **research and educational purposes only**.  
You must legally own a copy of Pokémon Yellow to use the ROM.
